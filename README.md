## Backstory

At the time that I was really into chess, the blitz mode was a whole other level to have fun and to play with my friends during high school. Then I realised that I wanted a Chess Clock so badly, and I was all set to buy one, but I realised how expensive they were. 

So, not willing to give up, I decided to make my own, it took me a couple of nights and a bunch of research to come up with the final result, but after it was done, playing chess was never more satisfying.

## Parts

### Arduino Programming
Project files are in the [code](https://github.com/LuisR-jpg/ChessClock/tree/master/Code) directory in this repository.
You'll find 4 different versions of the project there, don't hesitate to check them out!

### 3D Design
[3DModel](https://github.com/LuisR-jpg/ChessClock/tree/master/3DModel) directory has the final design of the clock. Ready to be 3D printed.

Check out the [render](https://github.com/LuisR-jpg/ChessClock/blob/master/3DModel/Chess%20Clock.stl)!

### Electronics
Arduino nano was used to handle all the processes this project implies.
